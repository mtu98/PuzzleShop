Imagine two 2x2 Rubik’s Cubes that rotate around the central axis allowing this puzzle to shape-shift. That’s right - it makes it very difficult to solve! This puzzle is sold in classic Hungarian packaging; similar in design to what the original Rubik’s Cube was retailed in when it first appeared. It is packaged in Hungary at Erno Rubik’s (the inventor of the Rubik’s Cube) very own studio and acts as a collector’s item as well as a fantastic toy. Be sure the rows are correctly aligned before turning the Rubik’s Tower and never use excessive force.",

        Description: "This is the new Rubik’s 2x2 with tough tiles. The traditional stickers have been replaced with plastic; which mean no fading, peeling or cheating! It also has a brand new mechanism that results in a smoother, faster and more reliable Rubik’s Cube. It might look easy but don’t be fooled – it is still a challenge. The 2x2 Rubik’s Cube (also known as the pocket or mini cube) consists of 8 corner cubies and operates in much the same way as its bigger brother – the Rubik’s Cube. As it is smaller than the traditional Rubik’s cube it can be more easily slipped into a pocket or bag, making it the perfect item to take on a bus, train or aeroplane. It also makes a great present for younger puzzle enthusiasts who might not be ready for a fully-fledged 3x3 Rubik’s Cube. The Rubik’s 2x2 Cube has 3,674,160 permutations and only one solution! Due to the new smoother movement, the 2x2 cube cannot be taken apart and hence we cannot replace any cubes that are broken as a result of attempted dis-assembly. No Hint Booklet or Stand included.",
